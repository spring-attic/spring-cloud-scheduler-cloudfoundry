The Spring Cloud Scheduler Cloud Foundry project provides a means to schedule short lived tasks to Cloud Foundry based on the Spring Cloud Scheduler SPI.

=== Building

Clone the repo and type

----
$ ./mvnw clean install

Below is a short list of common Spring Boot `@ConfigurationProperties` (in environment variable format) that you will
need to set in order to deploy applications to Cloud Foundry:

----
# url of the CF API (used when using cf login -a for example)
SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_URL

# name of the space into which modules will be deployed
SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SPACE

# name of the organization that owns the space above
SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ORG

# the root domain to use when mapping routes
SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DOMAIN

# Comma separated set of service instance names to bind to the deployed app
SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SERVICES

# username and password of the user to use to create apps
SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_USERNAME
SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_PASSWORD

# whether to allow self-signed certificates during SSL validation
SPRING_CLOUD_DEPLOYER_CLOUDFOUNDRY_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION
